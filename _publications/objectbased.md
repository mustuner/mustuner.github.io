## Abstract
<p align="justify">
With the latest development and increasing availability of high spatial resolution sensors, earth observation technology offers a viable solution for crop identification and management. There is a strong need to produce accurate, reliable and up to date crop type maps for sustainable agriculture monitoring and management. In this study, RapidEye, the first high-resolution multi-spectral satellite system that operationally provides a Red-edge channel, was used to test the potential of the data for crop type mapping. This study was investigated at a selected region mostly covered with agricultural fields locates in the low lands of Menemen (İzmir) Plain, TURKEY. The potential of the three classification algorithms such as Maximum Likelihood Classification, Support Vector Machine and Object Based Image Analysis is tested. Accuracy assessment of land cover maps has been performed through error matrix and kappa indexes. The results highlighted that all selected classifiers as highly useful (over 90%) in mapping of crop types in the study region however the object-based approach slightly outperforming the Support Vector Machine classification by both overall accuracy and Kappa statistics. The success of selected methods also underlines the potential of RapidEye data for mapping crop types in Aegean region.
