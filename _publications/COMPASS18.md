## Abstract
In terms of providing various scattering mechanisms, polarimetric target decompositions provide certain benefits for the interpretation of PolSAR images. This paper tested the capabilities of different polarimetric target decompositions in crop classification, while using a recently launched ensemble learning algorithm—namely Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). For the classification of different crops (maize, potato, wheat, sunflower, and alfalfa) in the test site, multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 images were acquired over an agricultural area near Konya, Turkey. Four different decomposition models (Cloude–Pottier, Freeman–Durden, Van Zyl, and Yamaguchi) were employed to evaluate polarimetric target decomposition for crop classification. Besides the polarimetric target decomposed parameters, the original polarimetric features (linear backscatter coefficients, coherency, and covariance matrices) were also incorporated for crop classification. The experimental results demonstrated that polarimetric target decompositions, with the exception of Cloude–Pottier, were found to be superior to the original features in terms of overall classification accuracy. The highest classification accuracy (92.07%) was achieved by Yamaguchi, whereas the lowest (75.99%) was achieved by the covariance matrix. Model-based decompositions achieved higher performance with respect to eigenvector-based decompositions in terms of class-based accuracies. Furthermore, the results emphasize the added benefits of model-based decompositions for crop classification using PolSAR data.
