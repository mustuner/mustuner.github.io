I  received my MSc and PhD degrees in Geomatic Engineering (Remote Sensing) from [Yildiz Technical University](https://bit.ly/38VCpb7) in 2014 and 2020, respectively. I was a short-term visiting researcher in the Geo-Spatial Analytics Lab at the [University of South Florida](www.usfsp.edu) in the United States, working with [Barnali Dixon](https://bit.ly/2x54xLW) during my master and was a visiting researcher in the [Department of Earth Observation](https://bit.ly/3acKpWA) at the [Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena](https://bit.ly/2x9ayaw) in Germany, working with [Christiane Schmullius](https://bit.ly/2vutNKX) during my PhD. 
 
My main research interests include PolSAR Remote Sensing, Applied Machine Learning and particularly ensemble learning algorithms. I'm the member of [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society](http://www.grss-ieee.org/) and [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.isprs.org/). I received the award for Top Reviewers for Geosciences - September 2018 from [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1175331/mustafa-ustuner/). I have been voluntarily working for the [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society](http://www.grss-ieee.org/) as the social media chair as well as the social media coordinator for [ISPRS Student Consortium](http://sc.isprs.org/home.html). I'm also a member of Information Resources for IEEE GRSS. 

I have been serving as an [Associate Editor](https://www.springer.com/journal/12517/editors) for the [Arabian Journal of Geosciences](https://www.springer.com/journal/12517). 
I'm a part of the organizing committee for [IGARSS 2020](https://igarss2020.org/default.asp) where serving for the publicity and outreach activities. 
Also, I'm serving as the [publicity co-chair](http://www.idrcongress.org/en/steering-committee) for the [International Disaster and Resilience Congress](http://www.idrcongress.org/en/anasayfa)

I am currently working for the [Department of Geomatic Engineering](https://harita.artvin.edu.tr/) in Artvin Coruh University as a research assistant.
