Welcome to my website!

I hold a PhD and a MSc in Geomatic Engineering (Yildiz Technical University, Turkey), and a BSc in Geodesy and Photogrammetry Engineering (Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey).

I was a short-term visiting researcher in the Geo-Spatial Analytics Lab at the [University of South Florida](www.usfsp.edu) in the United States, worked with [Barnali Dixon](https://bit.ly/2x54xLW) during my master and was a visiting researcher in the [Department of Earth Observation](https://bit.ly/3acKpWA) at the [Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena](https://bit.ly/2x9ayaw) in Germany, worked with [Christiane Schmullius](https://bit.ly/2vutNKX) during my PhD. 

I worked as a research assistant from March 2011 to June 2020 at the [Department of Geomatic Engineering](http://www.hrm.yildiz.edu.tr/en) in Yildiz Technical University. Currently, I am working for the [Department of Geomatic Engineering](https://harita.artvin.edu.tr/) in Artvin Coruh University.
 
My main research interests include Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) Remote Sensing, Applied Machine Learning and particularly ensemble learning algorithms. I'm the member of [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society](http://www.grss-ieee.org/) and [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.isprs.org/). I received the award for Top Reviewers for Geosciences - September 2018 from [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1175331/mustafa-ustuner/). I have been voluntarily working for the [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society](http://www.grss-ieee.org/) as the social media chair as well as the social media coordinator for [ISPRS Student Consortium](http://sc.isprs.org/home.html). 
I'm also a member of Information Resources for IEEE GRSS

I have been serving as an [Associate Editor](https://www.springer.com/journal/12517/editors) for the [Arabian Journal of Geosciences](https://www.springer.com/journal/12517). I was the publicity co-chair for [IGARSS 2020](https://igarss2020.org/OrganizingCommittee.asp) where serving for social media and outreach activities.

Also, I have been serving as a reviewer for the following journals: IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, International Journal of Remote Sensing, European Journal of Remote Sensing, Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing Letters, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, Geocarto International, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Remote Sensing, IEEE Access, IET Image Processing, Geo-Spatial Information Science, SN Applied Sciences, Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, Sensors and Turkish Journal of Remote Sensing and GIS.
